                <h2>
                    Get to know him:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Lord Buddha has been the founder of Buddhism. He was born in 563 B.C. at Lumbini of Kapilvastu
                    Nagar of the kingdom of
                    Nepal. Shuddhodan, the king of Shakya dynasty in the south of Nepal was his father.


                    Maya Devi was his mother. At the time of birth Lord Buddha’s name was Siddhartha. -A week after his
                    birth, his mother,
                    Maya Devi died and his step-mother Mahaprajapati brought him up. During the first sixteen years of
                    his life Siddhartha
                    received an education in policy of state administration and also in military science.

                    He was married to a girl named Yashodhara. After marriage, for three years he looked after the
                    state affairs. During
                    this period Siddhartha became a father to a son born from Yashodhara. The son was named Rahul.

                <h2>
                    His Journey:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even during his infancy Siddhartha was of peaceful nature and he evinced a tendency towards Sanyas,
                    i.e., (renouncing
                    the world). Consequently, he became interested in Yoga and turned indifferent to worldly pleasures
                    in the place.

                    His father provided everything for his comforts and got built a number of places for him for
                    various seasons summer,
                    winter and rainy. But Siddhartha was not at all attracted towards these comforts and luxuries and
                    his mood and various
                    activities betrayed indifference.

                    One day for a picnic he was taken to various places in the city in the princely chariot. In this
                    process he happened to
                    see an old person, and ailing person and a dead body. These three sights created disinterestedness
                    in him for the
                    world. So for seeking deliverance from birth, and death and disease he renounced his family and
                    went to some spiritual
                    guides.



                    On the Usbela Mountain he learnt Yogic practices for six years. But he could not understand the
                    mystery of birth and
                    death. Ultimately he meditated for twelve years beneath the Bodhi tree in Gaya.

                    After this he opened his eyes beneath the Bodhi tree and got Bodhi, that is, enlightenment. Now he
                    was called Gautam
                    Buddha. He received the Bodhi on the full moon day of the Hindu month Vaishakha (Vaishakhi
                    Purnima). At this time he
                    was about forty years of age.

                <h2>
                    How he conquered:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    After attaining enlightenment (Bodhi), Lord Buddha left the Bodhi tree (Gaya) and came to Kashi
                    (the modern Varanasi)
                    In Kashi, at the place Samath, heave his first sermons to five disciples, i.e., Bhikshus. These
                    sermons are famous as
                    Dharma-Chukra-Pravartan Sutra.

                    Lord Buddha sent these five Bhikshus to various places for preaching his ideals. The circle of his
                    disciples continued
                    widening. The easy and sweet language of Lord Buddha at once found a place in the hearts of
                    listeners. Within a few
                    days, throughout whole India Lord Buddha’s message was spread.




                    Men and women of all castes came within the fold of Buddhism. Thus Lord Buddha continued to preach
                    his religion for
                    about forty years. At last at the place known as Pawapur in Kushinagar, in the district of Deoria
                    (U.P.), Lord Buddha
                    left his body at the age 80 years.
